## Test_SPA

This document will provide you with an overview of the app and guide you through the process of setting it up and starting it.

**About the App** 
My app is an interface for SPA application. It provides users with access to a wide range of post. The app consists of two pages: the home page and the page with post description. The home page displays a list of available posts, while the post description page provides detailed information about each post.

The app is built using React, RTK Query and styled using SCSS.
